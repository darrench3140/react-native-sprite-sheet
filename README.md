# react-native-sprite-sheet

An up to date sprite sheet library for React Native. Compatible with Expo.

![demo](./documentation/demo.gif)

## Why

Sprite Animations are animation clips that are created for 2D assets. There are various ways to create Sprite Animations. One way is to create them from a Sprite Sheet, a collection of Sprites arranged in a grid. The Sprites are then compiled into an Animation Clip that will play each Sprite in order to create the animation, much like a flipbook.

By using a sprite sheet, the number of image files that need to be loaded is greatly reduced, which can result in faster loading times. In addition to performance and memory benefits, using a sprite sheet can also make it easier to organize and manage the assets of a game. When a game has multiple image files, it can be difficult to keep track of which image files are used where in the game. By using a sprite sheet, all of the sprites for a particular game are stored in a single file, which makes it easier to manage and organize the assets of the game.

## Installation

npm install @darrench3140/react-native-sprite-sheet

### Component:

```ts
import { AnimatedSprite, getFrames, type AnimatedSpriteType } from '@darrench3140/react-native-sprite-sheet'

const Component = () => {
    const animatedRef = useRef<AnimatedSpriteType>(null)

    // ...

    return (
        <AnimatedSprite
            ref={animatedRef}
            source={require('../assets/spritesheet/samurai/Samurai_Archer_Spritelist.psd')}
            spriteSheetSize={{ width: 2816, height: 1280 }}
            size={{ width: 200, height: 200 }}
            offset={offset}
            columnRowMapping={[9, 8, 8, 5, 5, 6, 14, 9, 3, 5]}
            frameSize={{ width: 128, height: 128 }}
            defaultAnimationName="idle"
            animations={{
                idle: getFrames(0, 8),
                walk: getFrames(9, 16),
                run: getFrames(17, 24),
                attack1: getFrames(25, 29),
                attack2: getFrames(30, 34),
                attack3: getFrames(35, 40),
                shot: getFrames(41, 54),
                jump: [...getFrames(55, 63), 0],
                hurt: getFrames(64, 66),
                dead: getFrames(67, 71),
            }}
        />
    )
}

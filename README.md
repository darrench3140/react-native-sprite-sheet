# react-native-sprite-sheet

An up to date sprite sheet library for React Native. 

![demo]()

## Why

Sprite Animations are animation clips that are created for 2D assets. There are various ways to create Sprite Animations. One way is to create them from a Sprite Sheet, a collection of Sprites arranged in a grid. The Sprites are then compiled into an Animation Clip that will play each Sprite in order to create the animation, much like a flipbook.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @darrench3140/react-native-sprite-sheet
```

## Usage


```js
import { multiply } from '@darrench3140/react-native-sprite-sheet';

// ...

const result = await multiply(3, 7);
```
